        <h2>What is Responsible Gaming?</h2>
        <p>Responsible gaming is all about balance. It means playing for enjoyment and excitement, not to escape problems or out of pressure. It also means knowing when it’s time to stop and taking a break when needed.</p>
        <p>At 6 Club, our games are designed for fun. You should feel relaxed and happy while playing. If the experience ever stops being enjoyable, that’s your cue to step away and take a pause.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="importance">
        <h2>Why Responsible Gaming is Important</h2>

        <p>Playing responsibly helps you:</p>
        <ul>
